This is the effective approach for designing InDel markers based on two parental genomes.

Use the first part bash script for creating candidate regions and then run the second one based on designed primers.

The final output is for designed markers which are ready-to-order and can be used for any of your own purposes like genotyping, recombination analysis, and etc.
